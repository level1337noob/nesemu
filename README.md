Incomplete NES Emulator
Need to touchup on the PPU with background and sprite rendering and timing perfectly to render and also fixing register bugs and adding temporary and main registers
Requires also the ImGui headers include it and debug the CPU

Some TODOs i forgot
Making the Opcode Disassembly in the Cpu Log only shows the registers pc sp processor status in their font style
Remaking the PPU scrolling v-ram address and shifting the attribute and background registers were bugged in timing so i had to remake it again
